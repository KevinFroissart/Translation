            <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">

                <p class="faq-txt1">CBD is completely legal in all 50 states. The FDA considers hemp and hemp-derived extracts to be food-based products. As such, there are no legal restrictions on their importation, production, sale or consumption in the United States, as well as most of the industrialized world. Hemp oil is legal in over 40 countries around the world. Hemp oil is consumed by millions of people around the world, and this number is rapidly rising as an increasing number of studies explore its many potential health benefits.</p>

            <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">

                <p class="faq-txt1">CBD is short for cannabidiol. Cannabidiol is an extract from hemp, a commonly used term for strains of the cannabis sativa plant with very low levels of THC. Hemp is used in a wide range of products in the United States and globally.</p>

            <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">

                <p class="faq-txt1">Hemp is not marijuana and will not get you ’high’. Hemp, or industrial hemp, is a commonly-used term for cannabis sativa plant strains which contain very low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and are typically used for its fiber and seeds.</p>

            <div class="accordion acdn-heading accordion-close">Will CBD help me?</div>

            <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">

                <p class="faq-txt1">Although not designated by the FDA as a health product, CBD has been shown in numerous studies to have various health benefits. Please read our product descriptions to identify the best products for you. There is also a wealth of research available online. However, we do not make any specific health claims about our products. As with any supplement, please consult your physician before use.</p>

            <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">

                <p class="faq-txt1">The first thing to remember is CBD is not THC and does not provide any psychoactive effects. The relaxing effect of CBD depends on many factors, including the amount consumed, the rate at which it is consumed, your body mass, and your metabolism.

            <div class="acdn-content" style="display: none;">

                <p class="faq-txt1">No. Hemp oil contains CBD, the non-psychoactive compounds of the cannabis plant. Hemp oil does not have the psychoactive qualities found in THC, and while using it you can maintain a clear minusd and active lifestyle.</p>
